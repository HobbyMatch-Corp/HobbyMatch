# HobbyMatch
The HobbyMatch app connects hobbyists and enthusiasts looking to find companions with similar interests to spend time together on activities of their choice. The app's user, or buisness client, registers for selected events, enriching their profile with the necessary information. Business clients, such as owners of gyms, workshops or sports grounds, have the option to share their facilities and reservation systems.
